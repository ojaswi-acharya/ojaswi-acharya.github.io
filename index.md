## Summary
I am a PhD candidate at Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am advised by Prof. Adam O’Neill. I am affiliated with the Cryptography lab. Before joining UMass, I did my undergraduate at Smith College.

My research interests lie within the field of Cryptography including functional encryption, secure aggregation and other applications. Currently I am working on function-revealing encryption and applications of functional encryption in privacy-preserving machine learning and data processing.
